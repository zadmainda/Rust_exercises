// A Vector can grow or shrink at runtime.

// A Vector is a homogeneous collection.

// A Vector stores data as sequence of elements in a particular order. Every element in a Vector is assigned a unique index number. The index starts from 0 and goes up to n-1 where, n is the size of the collection. For example, in a collection of 5 elements, the first element will be at index 0 and the last element will be at index 4.

// A Vector will only append values to (or near) the end. In other words, a Vector can be used to implement a stack.

// Memory for a Vector is allocated in the heap.;
